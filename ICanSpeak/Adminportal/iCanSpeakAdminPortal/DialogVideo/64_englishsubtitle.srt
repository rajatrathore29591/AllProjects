Swanson,

26
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,719
Dorothy Washington,
house manager.

27
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,679
Come on in.

28
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,399
Most everyone's at work,

29
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,039
but this house
fills up real good

30
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,119
around 7:00,
8:00 at night.

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,799
Your box came
yesterday.

32
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,799
Show me your
release sheet,

33
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,439
and then we'll
get you a room.

34
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,119
Ladies, this here
is Sherry Swanson.

35
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,879
Hey.

36
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,079
Hi.

37
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,999
You got some privacy,

38
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,999
but we don't lock
bedroom doors.

39
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,999
This is for the locker

40
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,119
where you store
all your valuables,

41
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,239
in the corner, there.

42
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,239
You get your house keys
after 30 days

43
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,519
with no write-ups:

44
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,959
No infractions
of our house rules,

45
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,119
do your chores,
all that.

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,879
I'm sure you'll be fine,
honey.

47
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,519
Yeah.

48
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,039
Get the phone!

49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,599
Do you like the blue ones,
the green ones?

50
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,639
The pink ones.

51
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,479
What size are you?

52
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,759
Bobby?

53
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,599
Hello?

54
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,319
Hey, it's Sherry.

55
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,679
Sherry, is that you?

56
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,439
Yeah, what's up?

57
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,079
You know, busy.

58
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,799
Listen, I got
to wrap it up.

59
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,679
Want a cigarette?

60
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,359
Yeah, okay, um...

61
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,919
That's cool.

62
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,759
Tell everybody
I said hi.

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,039
Yeah, I will.

64
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,199
Kiss my baby for me.

65
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,479
Kiss Lexi for me.
Tell her I'm coming.

66
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,079
What time are you
coming tomorrow?

67
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,159
After lunch.
Listen, I got to run.

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,959
Cool, peace.

69
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,639
Blanquita.

70
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,559
Blanquita,

71
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,519
you think you're
too good for us?

72
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,519
Destiny, chill out.

73
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,359
The girl just got
her release.

74
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,239
Parole office.

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,919
Could I talk to PO Hernandez?

76
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,399
Who's calling?

77
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,639
Swanson.

78
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,519
Parole number?

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
95-g4-620.

80
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,759
No crossing state lines without
permission from this office.

81
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,879
Any change in residence

82
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,759
must be reported
in writing.

83
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,039
Do you understand
the conditions

84
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,959
of your parole,
Ms. Swanson?

85
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,199
Mm-hmm.

86
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,079
Here's the rest
of your commissary.

87
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,439
Count it out
in front of me.

88
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,039
Sign the receipt.

89
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,359
Make sure it's
all there.

90
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,359
On each and every
reporting day,

91
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,839
you will submit
your pay stubs

92
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,239
along with this form.

93
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,199
Make sure the form
is filled out correctly.

94
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,279
Can I smoke in here?

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,559
Get a job as soon
as possible.

96
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,359
Otherwise, I have to see you
three times a week,

97
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,039
and, frankly, I don't have
the time for that right now.

98
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,839
Could I ask you
about something now, or...

99
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,599
Um, this--this
curfew thing?

100
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,959
I just, um--

101
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,759
I would like to spend the night
at my family's house,

102
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,599
at my brother's house.

103
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,799
I haven't seen them
for a long time.

104
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,039
I thought you had
no problems, Swanson.

105
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,919
Yeah.

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,719
Any unreported police contact

107
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,799
will result in the immediate
violation of your parole,

108
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,879
and I will violate you.

109
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,039
You will be returned
to prison

110
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,319
to serve the remainder
of your sentence,

111
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,399
plus any new charges
you may incur.

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,999
Monday at 9:00 a.m.
you report to Mr. Monroe

113
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,039
at 1138 Clifford street.

114
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,319
Can you please give me
a pass?

115
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,399
Are you trying to fuck
with me, Swanson?

116
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,759
Or are you here
to successfully

117
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,519
complete your parole?

118
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,919
To successfully complete
my parole, sir.

119
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,919
I just really...

120
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,639
I have to see my daughter.

121
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,959
I haven't seen her
in a long time.

122
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,119
Your brother's name
and address, what is it?

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,519
Robert Swanson.

124
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,599
1334 Ridge drive.

125
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,199
Slow down.

126
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,559
One...

127
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,319
334 Ridge drive.

128
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,759
Mountainside,
New Jersey.

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,239
Come on, there's nothing
to see here.

130
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,359
Come on, keep moving.
Keep moving.

131
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,039
Let's go.
Let's go.

132
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,759
Dump it.

133
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,039
Yo, bitch, why
you tripping, man?

134
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,039
See you later.

135
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,879
Good luck tomorrow,
okay?

136
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,759
Thanks, Andy.

137
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,599
Thanks for helping
me out.

138
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,559
How do you do?

139
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,319
Hey.

140
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,239
I'm Andy Kelly.

141
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,239
I'm the director
of this program.

142
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,719
Oh, hey, I'm Sherry.

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,759
I just got here.

144
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,279
Nice to meet you--
Sherry Swanson.

145
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,199
Yeah.

146
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,679
Right, I processed
your intake.

147
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,479
Oh.

148
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,119
Welcome to genesis house.

149
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,759
Thanks.

150
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,599
Is that your Bible?

151
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,839
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

152
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,159
Well, you know what
you should do?

153
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,799
Take a look at this one.

154
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,439
What's laid out in the first
164 pages of this book

155
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,839
is a program for life.

156
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,959
It's a program of change
that'll spin your head around

157
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,359
and make you happier
than you ever were

158
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,599
when you were on drugs
and alcohol.

159
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,799
I know all about it.

160
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,479
I did a year of 12-step
when I was locked up.

161
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,279
Really?

162
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,199
I, um...I like
the good book better.

163
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,359
Gotcha.

164
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,839
Do you want some coffee?

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,559
Yeah.

166
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,559
Please.

167
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,399
Oh stop, stop, stop.

168
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,439
Damn

169
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,279
I could go all night.

170
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,279
Look at this.

171
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,599
My friend shaved it.

172
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,279
You want to kiss it?

173
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,999
Come on, baby.

174
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,039
Come on. Kiss it.

175
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,479
Okay.

176
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,319
You have
a visitor.

177
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,319
Okay.

178
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,759
Oh, shit!

179
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,079
Put some meat
on your bones.

180
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,639
Yeah.

181
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,199
I missed you.

182
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,719
You should have
come see me.

183
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,119
Okay, let's get
the fuck out of here.

184
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,599
It's all pretty much the same.

185
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,879
The only thing different
is we got a new table.

186
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,599
Well, I guess Lynette
redecorated the living room.

187
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,679
We got Alexis a new bed.

188
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,639
She didn't want to get rid
of her little baby bed.

189
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,359
But you'll see;
Everything's the same.

190
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,079
It'll be like
you never left.

191
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,479
Did you hear
Chris Cuzar died?

192
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,999
How am I supposed
to hear that?

193
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,319
I don't know
who you talk to.

194
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,639
Nobody.

195
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,039
I don't talk
to nobody, Bob.

196
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,439
How'd he die,
from the dope?

197
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,799
Yep.

198
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,719
Shit, do you have
a cigarette?

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,279
Nope, I quit.

200
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,079
Fuck you.

201
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,079
Look at the little mermaid.

202
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
Don't go too far.

203
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,279
Come back here.

204
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,119
Get over here.

205
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,159
Munchkin.

206
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,079
Hey, girls.

207
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,039
Hey, hon.

208
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
Lynnie.

209
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,999
Hi, Sherry.

210
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,799
Welcome home.

211
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,719
Hi.

212
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,999
You're here,
wow.

213
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,239
Not going to hug you--
I'm wet.

214
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,159
You remember Sherry,
Lexi?

215
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,239
Mommy?

216
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,319
Hi.

217
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,199
I'm going
to clean the pool.

218
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,159
It's dirty.

219
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,279
Hey, baby.

220
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,639
Oh, you want
to hug me?

221
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,359
Yeah?

222
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,479
Oh, baby.

223
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,959
Oh, baby.

224
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,999
Oh, Lexi,
I'm so sorry.

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,239
I'm so sorry, baby.

226
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,359
I missed you
so much.

227
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,439
Where were you?

228
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,159
Mommy, mommy,

229
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,119
mommy, mommy.

230
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,719
Damn, girl,
you got heavy.

231
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,319
Mommy, mommy,
mommy.

232
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,239
Mommy, mommy, mommy,
mommy, mommy, mommy.

233
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,239
Mommy, mommy,
mommy, mommy.

234
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,439
Mommy, mommy,
mommy, mommy.

235
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,839
Mommy, mommy,
mommy, mommy.

236
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,359
Mommy, mommy,
mommy, mommy.

237
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,079
Don't jump on the couch,
sweetie.

238
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,959
Sit down, baby.

239
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,359
Let me put on
your robe.

240
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,359
Arm.

241
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,959
You want to see
your presents, baby?

242
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,439
What are you doing,
silly goose?

243
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,519
Okay, look at this one.

244
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,679
Look at that.

245
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,279
I picked that
for you.

246
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,239
Eeee.

247
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,439
I like that.

248
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,039
I think that's cute.

249
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,799
Okay, look at that.

250
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,519
I already got
that stuff.

251
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,679
You do?

252
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,759
Okay, whatever.

253
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,479
A Barbie.

254
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,319
Yeah, you like Barbie?

255
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,639
She's so pretty.

256
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,639
You do?

257
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,919
Oh, can I kiss her too?

258
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,239
Smooch!

259
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,519
Okay, now this present
is the most special one,

260
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,519
that's behind
my back.

261
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,479
This one is from
my best friend.

262
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,759
She made it.

263
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,479
She made it all
by herself for you.

264
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,959
Red, red, red.

265
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,239
Ohh.

266
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,319
I like it.

267
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,599
You like it?

268
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,159
Uh-huh.

269
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,439
You do?

270
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,079
Uh-huh.

271
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,599
Oh, I love you,
Lexi.

272
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,039
You want mommy to tell you
the story now

273
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,839
of what happened
to me?

274
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,719
Mm-hmm.

275
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,639
Yeah?

276
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,839
Look, honey,
come here.

277
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,399
I want to tell you
the truth, okay?

278
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,919
Okay?

279
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,079
And sometimes
it's not easy

280
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,199
to tell the truth;
You know what I mean?

281
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,479
Mm-hmm.

282
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,359
I did a bad thing,
and they sent me to jail.

283
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,999
Do you know
what that is?

284
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,959
What bad thing?

285
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,119
I stole from people.

286
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,239
I stole from people
to get money for drugs.

287
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,359
Mm-hmm.

288
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,599
Oh, baby,
come here.

289
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,359
Oh, honey, I missed you
so, so, so, so much.

290
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,599
I used to talk to you.

291
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,879
Did you hear me?

292
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,839
Mm-mm.

293
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,479
No?

294
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,919
Lord, please, please, please,

295
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,759
please, please
hear my extra prayer tonight.

296
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,639
Forgive me my weaknesses
and my mistakes.

297
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,639
Give me the strength
to take life one day at a time

298
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,879
and take care
of my daughter again, amen.

299
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,439
Three years in Clinton, huh?

300
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,239
Well, there's the Del Monte
plant in Irvington,

301
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,439
just started hiring
new people.

302
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,239
Actually, I would like
to work with kids.

303
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,599
Kids?

304
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,839
Yes, I graduated the parenting
from the inside program,

305
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,839
and I worked 13 months

306
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,239
in the family trailers
and 6 in the children's center.

307
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,599
So I'd like to work
in a head start

308
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,159
or a day care
or something like that.

309
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,599
Uh-huh.

310
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,439
Also, I have a child.

311
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,919
And I would like to become
a better mother.

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,479
Swanson, you're a young,
pretty girl.

313
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,319
If you don't want to work

314
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,119
in the factory,

315
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,559
you know, maybe you could
wait tables, cocktail--

316
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,679
oh, no, no, no, no,

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,079
not--not with...

318
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,199
Hmm.

319
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,999
Wait, I, um...

320
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,679
I have some papers.

321
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,039
This is from
the parenting program.

322
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,199
Okay.

323
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,679
This one is from
the children's center.

324
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,799
Okay.

325
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,759
And...

326
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,799
And...And what?

327
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,039
Nice.

328
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,759
I'll suck your dick if you give
me the job I want.

329
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,399
The fuck you looking at?

330
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,519
The courage to change
the things I can,

331
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,279
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

332
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,759
Tonight Dean will be reading
the preamble.

333
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,999
My name's Dean.

334
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,679
I'm an alcoholic
and an addict.

335
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,279
Hi, Dean.

336
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,439
Genesis recovery

337
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,359
is a fellowship
of men and women

338
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,839
who share their experience,

339
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,399
strength, and hope
with each other,

340
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,799
that they may solve
their common problem

341
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,439
and help others to recover

342
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,799
from alcoholism
and drug addiction.

343
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,239
Is there anyone here tonight

344
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,959
that feels the need
to drink or use?

345
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,439
Go ahead, little sister.

346
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,839
Don't be shy.

347
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,359
Um, I'm Sherry.
I'm an addict.

348
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,439
Hi, Sherry.

349
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,599
Um, I've got
21/2 years clean.

350
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,599
I got clean in prison,

351
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,479
and I've been out
for four days,

352
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,519
and...

353
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,839
I feel like using so bad.

354
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,359
From the age of 16 to 22,
heroin was the love of my life.

355
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,999
I mean, I had a daughter,

356
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,719
and I never even
took care of her,

357
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,719
and I want
to take care of her,

358
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,799
but I got to...

359
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,599
Stay clean,
so I'm just here

360
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,439
to stay clean and...

361
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,879
That's all I got.

362
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,079
Hey, Sherry.

363
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,279
Hey.

364
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,439
Listen, don't worry
about your problems.

365
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,639
I mean,
you're not alone.

366
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,839
Like, me, I could
completely relate

367
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,519
to what you
were saying,

368
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,679
because I come

369
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,959
from a dysfunctional,
alcoholic family.

370
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,479
And drugs were part
of my entire teenage life.

371
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,719
When I was growing up,

372
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,559
I knew we weren't supposed
to be doing drugs,

373
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,239
but everyone
was doing them anyway,

374
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,079
so I just--
I just fell into that, you know?

375
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,399
She's not hearing you,
friend.

376
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,839
She's got too much
on her mind.

377
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,639
Do you need
a ride home?

378
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,279
Okay, thanks.

379
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,079
He's right, Andy.
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,319
I'll catch up with you
tomorrow.

381
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,519
Sherry, did you ever

382
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,919
work at Tony Martino's joint,
the paradise?

383
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,999
I used to cook speed

384
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,239
in a warehouse
over at South Kearny.

385
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,679
Tony was
one of my partners.

386
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,799
What's your name again?

387
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,199
Dean Walker.

388
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,239
Dean Walker?

389
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,879
I don't know you.

390
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,279
Man, I was, like, 16
when I worked there, I think.

391
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,159
Tony named me Lolita.

392
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,279
That was my stage name
because I was so young, Lolita.

393
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,159
I had really long hair.

394
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,199
Yeah, I remember.

395
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,359
You do?

396
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,639
You know
they closed that place down.

397
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,639
Why,

398
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,079
too many underage girls?

399
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,919
No,

400
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,839
it all came down

401
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,319
when Richardson
got into office.

402
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,359
Tony lost all his juice.

403
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,999
Where's he at, anyways?

404
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,399
Greenhaven.

405
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,359
He got busted making a big move
in the city last year.

406
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,239
They gave him 15 to life.

407
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,239
15 to life.

408
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,879
Damn, that's deep.

409
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,999
He probably deserved it,
though, right?

410
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,319
Ugh!

411
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,959
Do you know Richie Parks?

412
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,999
Richie Parks.

413
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,399
No, I don't know him.
Who's that?

414
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,119
He's another lowlife
scumbag.

415
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,439
He's also my baby's daddy.

416
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,999
He broke out a while ago.

417
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,879
I don't know
if he's alive or dead.

418
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,879
Do you have kids?

419
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,199
Oh, yeah.

420
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,319
I got three boys
and two girls.

421
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,239
They all live in Oklahoma
with their mamas.

422
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,479
Hmm.

423
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,439
Do you take care of them?

424
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,239
Oh, yeah,
I do now.

425
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,319
So far away.

426
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,519
Yeah.

427
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,479
Okay, thanks, man.

428
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,039
Good night, little sister.

429
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,319
And you take care,
all right?

430
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,999
And be careful.

431
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,319
Bye.

432
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,439
I love you too.

433
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,959
All right.

434
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,719
Okay, bye.

435
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,959
What's up?

436
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,079
Some fucking real-life
bullshit I had to deal with
today.

437
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,799
Are you done
with the phone?

438
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,439
Yeah, go ahead.

439
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,159
I forgot how it gets,
you know.

440
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,799
Here I was,
thinking prison was the worst;

441
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,639
this was gonna be, like,
some kind of heaven,

442
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,279
but it ain't, you know?

443
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,799
I heard that.

444
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,239
That job shit
got me tight.

445
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,519
You all right?

446
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,759
Good looking out,
girl.

447
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,679
Ain't no thing.

448
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,279
What are you looking at?

449
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,919
Damn, white girl,
you are always on the phone.

450
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,319
¿Estas sorda?

451
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,239
Hey, Lynette.
Hi.

452
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,999
How are you?
It's Sherry.

453
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,079
Is Bobby there?

454
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,559
Don't you hear me?

455
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,839
Ah--
hey, Bobby, what's up?

456
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,799
It's Sherry, yeah.

457
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,559
How you doing?

458
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,999
Yeah?

459
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,239
Cool. Listen, I called
to talk to Alexis, actually.

460
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,319
Is she there?

461
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,519
Why, you think
you're something special?

462
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,519
What? She's sleeping?

463
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,479
Wait.
Hold on a second.

464
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,799
Fucking get out of
my face.

465
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,559
Bitch.

466
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,039
Uh...

467
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,999
Okay, well,

468
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,679
I'm gonna call back tomorrow,
then, early,

469
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,279
because I really want
to talk to her, okay?

470
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,039
Okay.

471
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,399
Okay, Bobby.
Bye.

472
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,759
Have you got a problem
with me?

473
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,479
Yeah, I got a problem
with you, bitch.

474
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,679
You jealous of me
or something?

475
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,999
Your mother's a bitch.

476
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,679
Oh, my mother's a bitch?

477
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,959
My mother's dead.

478
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,599
Fucking stupid crackhead.

479
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,839
Well, you turned out good.

480
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,959
Look at you.

481
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,319
Your daddy's a
fucking
baby raper.

482
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,279
Get the fuck--

483
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,279
fuck you, you fucking cunt.

484
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,159
Call the cops!

485
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,559
You hear me?
You hear me?

486
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,079
Fuck you, puta!

487
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,039
Now that you've both been
fucked, you should feel better.

488
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,359
You bitch.

489
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,519
You don't fuck with me,
because I will hurt you.

490
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,439
Go to your rooms.

491
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,359
Now!

492
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,959
Or I'm calling 911.

493
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,079
Go.

494
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,799
Sherry, wake up.

495
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,079
Oh.

496
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,119
What's going on?

497
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,199
Sorry.

498
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,719
Sorry to show up like this.

499
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,959
Bob.

500
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,919
Yes, hon?

501
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,679
Your sister's here.

502
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,559
Hey.

503
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,239
Hey.

504
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,679
What are you
doing here?

505
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,919
Mommy!

506
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,359
Hey.
Oh.

507
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,079
Hey, Lexi.

508
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,439
How you doing, kiddo?

509
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,039
Why do you have
a garbage bag?

510
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,079
A garbage bag?

511
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,359
Okay, come on.

512
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,039
Let's finish getting ready
for camp.

513
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,839
I can't stay at that place.

514
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,999
It's like being in prison
all over again.

515
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,279
I know. I know.
I hear you.

516
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,639
Mm.

517
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,599
But don't you
have to stay there?

518
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,599
No.

519
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,599
I can live
wherever I want.

520
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,999
I just have a curfew.

521
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,359
You take sugar?

522
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,479
No.

523
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,399
Milk?

524
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,079
No, thanks.

525
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,519
So, Bobby,

526
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,879
I'm not asking
to move in here.

527
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,839
Okay?

528
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,359
But I do need to stay here
for a little while.

529
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,679
Two weeks.

530
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,999
If I stay at that place,

531
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,039
I'm gonna violate.

532
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,959
I can feel it.

533
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,159
Okay.

534
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,599
Okay.

535
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,239
No drugs in this house,
Sherry.

536
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,759
You bring drugs in here,
and I'm going to call the cops.

537
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,839
Bobby,

538
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,079
how many times
do I got to tell you this?

539
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,839
I'm clean.

540
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,199
Okay.

541
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,679
Promise?

542
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,919
Hey, my baby.

543
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,079
I'm going to camp now,
Sherry.

544
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,519
"Sherry"?

545
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,519
You want to give your mama
a kiss?

546
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,839
I think you do.

547
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,799
Alexis.

548
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,159
An Eskimo kiss?

549
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,239
You're gonna be late
for camp.

550
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,399
You remember
what that one is?

551
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,639
Smooch!

552
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,839
You have a good day,
baby.

553
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,679
Mm-hm.

554
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,559
Okay.

555
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,999
Bye, Alexis.

556
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,439
Have a good day,
okay?

557
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,599
Bye, baby.

558
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,639
Oh, yeah,
here's your lunch.

559
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,799
Bye, Sherry.

560
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,959
What the fuck was that?

561
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,839
What?

562
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,759
She just called me Sherry.

563
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,079
Yeah.

564
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,919
Me and Lynette were trying
to talk to you about that

565
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,759
the last time
you were here.

566
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,479
You want to help me
with these boxes?

567
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,959
Yeah, babe.

568
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,879
I'll be right back.

569
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,239
Oh, yeah,
whatever.

570
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,799
I'm her--
I'm her fucking mother.

571
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,759
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

572
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,759
You want one?

573
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,119
Sure.

574
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,159
Thanks.

575
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,839
You don't think these pants
are too tight, do you?

576
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,519
Turn around.
Let me see you.

577
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,079
No, you got a good figure.

578
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,479
You look cute.

579
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,479
You think Lexi's
gonna get my body?

580
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,439
I don't know.

581
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,759
I do.

582
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,679
That girl is going to be
tall and skinny.

583
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,399
Watch.

584
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,039
I'm gonna look out
for her.

585
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,719
Want me to do your makeup
later?

586
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,359
Would you?

587
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,759
Sure.

588
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,639
Just let me
finish this first.

589
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,599
I'm going to do your eyes purple
to match your pants, okay?

590
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,559
And I'll give it to you
when I'm done,

591
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,199
so you can have it.

592
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,919
I never got a professional
makeup job before.

593
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,119
Thank you.

594
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,159
You know, every Friday night
in my cell,

595
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,119
we'd have ladies' night.

596
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,159
We'd put on face masks
and wear lingerie

597
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,359
and stuff like that.

598
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,279
Lingerie in jail.

599
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,559
You're really nuts.

600
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,719
That's what happens

601
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,239
when you got to wear
state clothes every day.

602
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,879
You didn't go with any girls,
did you?

603
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,399
No.

604
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,879
Some girls in there
tried to get with me,

605
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,799
but I told them
what time it was.

606
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,079
Daddy.

607
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,479
Sherry Anne.

608
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,359
What's that?

609
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,319
Hi.

610
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,279
How are you?

611
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,359
Well, we got
into some traffic.

612
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,319
Hey, Marcia.

613
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,279
Hey, how you doing?

614
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,319
Good.

615
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,599
Don't cry.
You'll make me cry.

616
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,559
Oh.

617
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,439
Come on, stop it.

618
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,719
It's okay.

619
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,999
We should have taken 22,
and...

620
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,879
I missed you so much.

621
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,719
I missed you too.

622
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,519
Come on,
say hi to my wife.

623
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,959
Look at my makeup.

624
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,199
It's real pretty.

625
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,639
Yeah, we took 78, and--

626
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,679
remember Marcia?

627
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,319
Hi.

628
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,199
Hi.

629
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,079
Bob.

630
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,439
Hey, dad.

631
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,679
You really got to clean out
those gutters, you know?

632
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,279
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I know.

633
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,079
This ought
to help you out.

634
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,999
You know, dad,

635
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,839
you don't
have to give me money.

636
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,999
Grandpa's here.

637
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,879
Oh, there she is.

638
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,919
Oh, Lexi.

639
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,199
There's my precious
little girl.

640
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,559
Here, honey.
This is for you.

641
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,999
Can I just
fix this?

642
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,199
Dad.

643
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,399
Oh, this is hot.

644
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,559
Attagirl.

645
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,119
Look at you and grandpa.

646
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,559
What do you say, Alexis?

647
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,759
Thank you, grandma.

648
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,759
You're welcome.

649
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,799
Hey, dad.

650
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,879
Hey, dad.

651
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,319
Dad, look at how much
we look alike

652
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,359
now that she's
got bigger.

653
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,479
Look at that.

654
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,079
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

655
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,959
What do you got there?

656
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,239
Dad.

657
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,439
Dad, there's a--
I want to show you something.

658
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,999
Daddy.

659
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,079
Come on.

660
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,159
I want to show you
something.

661
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,119
Come on.
Let's go see what Sherry wants.

662
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,279
I got my GED.

663
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,159
Okeydoke.

664
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,119
Okeydoke.

665
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,319
I want to show you.

666
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,679
I want to welcome home
my baby,

667
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,639
Sherry Anne.

668
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,439
Welcome home,
Sher.

669
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,279
Cheers. Cheers.

670
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,919
Cheers.

671
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,799
I want soda.

672
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,639
Milk first.

673
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,639
Then you'll get
your soda.

674
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,079
Hey, Lynnie,
this sure looks good.

675
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,039
Did you help with this?

676
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,479
No.

677
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,439
So how's the caddy
holding up, dad?

678
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,599
Eat your burger first.

679
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,079
It's the perfect piece
of machinery.

680
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,359
You know, you've had
that car so long,

681
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,479
I don't think it's safe
for you

682
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,279
to drive it down to Florida
this year.

683
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,319
I don't think so either.

684
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,399
You need a new car,
dad.

685
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,199
Now?

686
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,359
Okay.

687
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,199
I swear, she's hooked
on the Disney channel.

688
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,319
Did you see that email

689
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,399
Marty sent around?

690
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,599
Bobby, that's disgusting.

691
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,319
We're eating here.

692
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,759
They're going to start charging
for emails, you know.

693
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,519
Alexis, come eat
more of your burger.

694
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,599
That's what I keep saying,
you know.

695
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,079
That Marty,
he's a real piece of work.

696
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,279
I don't know
where he finds that stuff,

697
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,479
but he does.

698
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,159
Come on, pass me
that potato salad.

699
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,359
There you go.

700
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,079
I don't want to waste room
on salad.

701
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,319
Yeah?

702
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,199
You do?

703
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,479
Yeah.

704
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,679
Okay, Alexis wants
to hear me sing for you all.

705
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,199
Spare us, Sher.

706
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,799
We don't want to break
any glasses.

707
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,679

Should have gone
on American idol.

730
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,239
You'd probably win.

731
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,919
Don't be a wise guy.

732
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,559
Sherry's a good singer.

733
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,639
Beautiful, baby.

734
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,239
Okay, I'm going to get
some more wine.

735
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,079
Come on, baby bear.

736
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,279
I'm putting him in.

737
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,439
I'm putting him in.

738
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,839
I think this looks good
like that.

739
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,399
Can I come in yet?

740
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,359
Nope.

741
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,639
Is that good?

742
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,159
Yeah, that's good.

743
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,559
This can be your baby.

744
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,359
And this can be mine.

745
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,159
What's your baby's name?

746
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,319
My baby...

747
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,839
Um...

748
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,839
My baby is named Alexis.

749
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,359
No!

750
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,079
What do you mean, "no"?

751
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,799
This is pretend,

752
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,719
and you have to pick
a new name.

753
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,719
Why?

754
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,319
Because.

755
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,839
But Alexis
is my favorite name.

756
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,879
No.

757
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,199
Besides, there could be
two Alexises.

758
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,519
Well, okay.

759
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,319
You can call her that,

760
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,759
but then my baby's name
can be Sherry.

761
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,039
Two Alexises
and two Sherrys.

762
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,319
Two Alexises...

763
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,079
And two Sherrys.

764
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,599
Ah!

765
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,799
Mm-mm.

766
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,639
In the fort,
in here.

767
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,039
Let's go.
Okay.

768
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,039
Should I take
this Sherry?

769
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,879
Lynnie told me to call you
Sherry, not mommy.

770
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,359
Yeah, I figured.

771
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,319
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

772
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,759
When you come
and live with me,

773
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,359
you can call me mommy again,
okay?

774
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,799
Alexis, grandma Mary's here
to see you.

775
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,319
Grandma Mary.

776
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,639
No, baby.

777
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,479
She's waiting.

778
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,639
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

779
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,079
Hi, grandma.

780
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,319
You are confusing her
with this Sherry
bullshit.

781
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,919
I'm confusing her?

782
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,119
I don't think so.

783
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,639
She was fine
until you showed up again.

784
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,159
I'm her mother.

785
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,159
Well, act like one.

786
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,439
What, are you
fucking
jealous?

787
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,919
You want to--you're gonna
curse in front of her?

788
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,479
You want to see
my stretch marks, Lyn?

789
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,719
Don't be disgusting.

790
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,959
Check this out.
You want to check this out?

791
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,039
It's just too many people
in a house.

792
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,679
I told you, you can't just keep
sleeping on the floor like that.

793
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,719
You should be on my side.

794
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,039
Here, you need some cash?

795
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,719
Daddy gave me
some cash.

796
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,719
Sherry, here.

797
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,599
I'm your fucking sister.

798
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,919
Shit!

799
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,399
I'll just wait out here,

800
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,759
make sure you get a room.

801
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,999
Dean, hey, it's Sherry,

802
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,159
Tony Martino's girl.

803
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:13,879
Yeah.

804
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,359
Yeah, I met you
at genesis recovery, remember?

805
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,959
I was just, um...

806
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,479
Uh...

807
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,759
Well, I was just calling
because I was--

808
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,119
I was...

809
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,599
I was wondering if, um--

810
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,479
what you were doing.

811
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,599
Who's there?

812
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,879
Dean.

813
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,039
Greetings.

814
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,479
Damn, you got here late.

815
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,079
Oh, no.

816
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,479
Damn.

817
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,079
You like my hair?

818
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,599
Yeah, it ain't bad.

819
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,679
Ooh, look at that.

820
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,279
Mhmm. Mhmm.

821
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,599
Looking good, little Lolita.

822
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,719
Mm, don't call me that.

823
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,999
You've gotta stop drinking that
poison.

824
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,559
Did you ever see me dance?

825
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,839
Oh yeah.

826
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,079
Are you gonna dance for me
tonight?

827
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,079
No. I gave that shit up.

828
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,679
Good little girl.

829
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,239
Doesn't dance for anybody
anymore.

830
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,039
You had any police contact
this weekend, Swanson?

831
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:43,839
No, but I called--

832
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,799
on the wall!

833
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,239
Get your hands
on the wall now!

834
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,639
I told you I was going
to my brother's house.

835
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,079
I called you. I left you a--
you didn't get my message?

836
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:50,959
Shut up.

837
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,759
What the fuck?

838
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,959
Stay where you want,

839
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,999
but you will go through
the proper channels.

840
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,039
Spread 'em.
Kick your shoes off.

841
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,719
Let's go.
Kick 'em off.

842
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,159
Kick 'em off!

843
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,399
Spread 'em out.
Come on, let's go.

844
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,719
You've done this before.

845
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,919
Pat her down.

846
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,719
Keep that chest
pressed against the wall.

847
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,879
You think just because you can
send me back to prison,

848
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,679
you're strong?

849
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,559
Control yourself.

850
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,279
I'm strong.

851
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,999
Shut up.

852
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,159
Stand up straight.

853
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,439
Right foot up.
Right foot up.

854
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,519
Right foot up.

855
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,839
You are fucking with
the wrong one today.

856
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:18,799
Put your right foot up.

857
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,759
Get your foot up!

858
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,399
Left foot up.

859
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,559
Left foot up.

860
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,839
Spread 'em.
Officer.

861
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,999
I could violate your ass
right now,

862
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,399
send you back to prison
for two more years.

863
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,919
Is that what you want?

864
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,799
But a job came through
for you,

865
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,759
and I'm going
to let you take it.

866
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,559
Top of your head.
Look away.

867
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,879
Listen,
I'm going to do good.

868
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,319
Just--just be quiet.

869
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,119
I graduated a lot of programs
when I was in prison.

870
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,679
Look, shut up.

871
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,399
Put your shoes back on.

872
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,439
It's a catholic charities
youth organization,

873
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,919
summer program
over on Irvine Turner.

874
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,599
Monroe somehow convinced them

875
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,079
that you'd been
rehabilitated.

876
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,519
Here's the address.

877
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,559
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

878
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,599
Thank you.

879
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,239
Everybody in line?
Everybody ready?

880
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,959
I want to see if you guys
are tough.

881
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,439
All right.
Okay, come on.

882
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,799
Let's see what you got.

883
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,999
Good, good.

884
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,119
Okay, end of the line.

885
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,719
What's your name?

886
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,639
Zak.

887
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,799
Okay, Zak,
let's see what you got.

888
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,639
Uh-huh, uh-huh,

889
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,559
but this is what
you got to do.

890
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,279
You got to bend
your knees, see?

891
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,879
And you got
to follow through.

892
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,839
Okay, let's see.

893
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,719
Follow through.
Good, good.

894
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,599
You are a little badass.

895
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,439
One more.

896
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,319
Ow!

897
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,719
Ow, he's strong.

898
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,479
He's--how about you?

899
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,519
What have you got?

900
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,559
You got to show me
a little harder.

901
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,359
I want to see
that power you got.

902
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,279
Good.

903
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,799
Yeah, you know
what you're doing.

904
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,119
You got to bend
your knees.

905
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,919
You got to focus,
chastity.

906
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:26,759
You got to focus.

907
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,759
You got to focus.

908
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,159
Yeah, what's your name?

909
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,479
Russel.
That's good, Russel.

910
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,919
One more, Russel.
You got one more.

911
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,439
Good, good, good.

912
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,599
All right,
I know your name.

913
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,319
Let's see--

914
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,239
okay.

915
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,439
We can't play
this game anymore.

916
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,559
Let's play another game.

917
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,239
Let's play zoo.

918
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,639
Okay, who told me
they wanted to be a dinosaur?

919
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,759
What's up?

920
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,919
What are you
doing here?

921
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,599
I just came by
to say hey.

922
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,159
Uh...I'm kind of busy
right now.

923
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,239
Oh, yeah?

924
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,319
Yeah.

925
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,079
You got a broad
in there?

926
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,119
I fucking thought
you liked me, man.

927
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,319
I do like you.

928
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,679
Hey, no, wait,
wait, wait.

929
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,039
From a bank robbery

930
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,879
at 10913rd Avenue.

931
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,839
A male black
about 6 feet tall

932
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,679
with one eye,
wearing a white do-rag

933
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,799
under a yellow hard hat.

934
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,079
The direction?

935
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,719
It's heading...

936
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,399
All right, come back
in 20 minutes, all right?

937
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,359
Yeah, okay.
Okay!

938
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,799
20 minutes.

939
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,479
So what's her name?

940
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,479
Where does she live?

941
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,759
Why should I tell you?

942
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,239
So you can hunt her down
and beat her ass?

943
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,319
No, I'm not going back
to prison, Dean.

944
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,119
I just want to know
who this bitch is

945
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,879
you'd rather be fucking
than me.

946
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,759
Now, why you want
to go down that road?

947
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,199
Ha, yeah.

948
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,919
Tell me more.

949
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,439
I bet you wouldn't
like it

950
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,879
if I started fucking
Andy Kelly.

951
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,039
It wouldn't matter
to me.

952
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,759
Oh, no?

953
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,919
Fucking figures.

954
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,799
At least he knows
how to eat pussy.

955
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,439
What was that?
I didn't hear you.

956
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,479
Nothing.

957
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,079
I'm sorry.

958
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,319
I'm such a piece of shit.

959
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,759
Sometimes
I can't control myself.

960
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,919
Nobody owns anybody.

961
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,919
The state of New Jersey
owns my ass.

962
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,039
I miss my friend, man.

963
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,519
Crusher.

964
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,239
She always had my back.

965
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,039
Well, I can be your friend.

966
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,679
It's not about that.

967
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,319
What are you cooking?

968
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,039
Venison stew.

969
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,439
What's that?

970
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,159
It's deer meat.

971
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,279
Mmm.

972
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,319
I never ate Bambi before.

973
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,839
Well, actually,
it isn't Bambi.

974
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,639
It's Bambi's daddy.

975
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,599
Ooh, yeah?

976
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,399
Bambi's daddy,
that's pretty funny.

977
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,119
Bobby, hey, what's up?

978
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,919
Yeah?

979
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,919
I had my first day
of work today.

980
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,159
It was cool.

981
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,799
Made me think of my baby.

982
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,679
Is she there?
I really want to talk to her.

983
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,159
Why do you always got to tell me
the same shit, Bobby?

984
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,119
I know she's there.

985
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,399
I know she's fucking awake.

986
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,359
It's 7:30.

987
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:25,959
What about her birthday?

988
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,359
You guys have
anything planned?

989
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,679
Oh, yeah, I will--
I will be there.

990
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,479
♪ Yeah, we do! ♪

991
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,239
Okay, at this next block,

992
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,839
turn left.

993
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,599
Yes, ma'am.

994
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,039
It's the third house
on the left.

995
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,359
You grew up there?

996
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,839
Yup.

997
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,559
That's fancy.

998
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,999
I guess.

999
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:04,959
You want to come in

1000
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,639
and meet my family?

1001
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,199
No, no, you go
and enjoy your daughter.

1002
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,759
Call me when you're ready
to be picked up.

1003
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,079
All right,
I'll see you later.

1004
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,439
Bye-bye.

1005
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,559
Hello!

1006
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,959
Hey, wait.

1007
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:39,759
Dean!

1008
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,959
Dean, wait!
Wait! Wait!

1009
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,839
Those fuckers aren't home.

1010
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,479
What do you want
to do?

1011
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,799
Um...

1012
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,119
Let's go
to my dad's house.

1013
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,079
Maybe they're there.

1014
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,839
You're late.
We just finished the cake.

1015
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,839
Well, maybe if you'd told me
where the party was at--

1016
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,599
hold on one second.

1017
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,559
Hey, Alexis, I think you have
more presents to open.

1018
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,959
Don't push me.

1019
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,439
Hi, Alexis.

1020
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,679
Alexis, hey.

1021
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,199
Happy Birthday, baby.

1022
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,879
Happy Birthday.

1023
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,039
Happy, happy,
Happy Birthday.

1024
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,559
Sherry brought you
some presents.

1025
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,439
What do you say?

1026
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,799
Thanks.

1027
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,919
Here you go, babe.

1028
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,119
Can I open it?

1029
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,679
Go ahead; Open it.

1030
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,079
Open all of them.
Open them.

1031
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,599
I want to open one.

1032
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,559
Oh, look at this.

1033
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,679
You're going to look
just like a ballerina.

1034
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,839
Sherry Anne.

1035
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,759
Welcome.

1036
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,119
Can I get you a drink?

1037
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,119
Yeah, thanks.

1038
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,639
Number two.

1039
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,279
I don't want to play anymore!

1040
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,039
Look at it.
Look at the front, though.

1041
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,039
Candy lipstick.

1042
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,239
And this is special gum.

1043
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,319
Special gum?

1044
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,599
Yeah, but it's inside.

1045
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,719
So much candy.

1046
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,519
You want to open it?

1047
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,519
Game boy.

1048
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,039
You have one of those
already, sweetie.

1049
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,799
You do?
I could take it back.

1050
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,039
If you want to,
I'll find you something else.

1051
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:48,759
No.

1052
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,279
I want two game boys.

1053
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,839
You can't have two;
That's silly.

1054
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,679
You can have
whatever you want, baby.

1055
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,199
Lookit. You got finger paints.

1056
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,239
No!

1057
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,319
That's my present!

1058
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,519
It's mine.

1059
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,079
No fair.

1060
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,239
It's my present.

1061
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,279
Yes, honey.

1062
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,279
Alexis.

1063
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,439
It's your present.

1064
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,519
Nobody is going to take it
away from you.

1065
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,199
What happened?

1066
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,039
What's going on?

1067
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,239
Let's go, guys.

1068
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,079
Let's go downstairs
and play musical chairs.

1069
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,399
Let's go, everybody.

1070
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,999
I think they need
some time out.

1071
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,159
You come too.

1072
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,639
Here we go, everybody.

1073
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,519
We're all coming.

1074
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,039
What a mess, huh?

1075
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,999
Whoo!

1076
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,359
Okay, not fair.

1077
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,119
You all right?

1078
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,639
Dad,

1079
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,079
I feel like--

1080
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,679
I don't know what to do.

1081
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,039
I feel like they're taking her
away from me.

1082
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,439
What are you
talking about?

1083
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,519
Bobby and Lynette,
they love you a whole lot.

1084
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,279
I love you.

1085
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,999
Dad, she won't even talk to me.

1086
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,079
You should have seen her
when I first came back.

1087
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,439
She was playing with me.

1088
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,439
She was hugging me.

1089
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,799
She was calling me mommy.

1090
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,999
They told her
not to call me mommy anymore.

1091
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,159
Can you believe that shit?

1092
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,879
Sherry, just give them
some time

1093
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,199
to get used to you again.

1094
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,799
Come on.

1095
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,199
I know, but...

1096
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,199
Come on.

1097
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,479
Just give it a little time,
honey.

1098
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,799
What?

1099
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,599
Sherry, what?

1100
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,879
Baby, you got
that taste?

1101
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,759
Keep you coming back.

1102
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,359
It works if you work it.

1103
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,079
It won't if you don't.

1104
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,119
What happened to you?

1105
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,839
I walked home, man.

1106
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,159
You're also fucked up.

1107
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,439
Come on;
Let's go clean you up.

1108
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,719
Hey, lay off the goods,
man.

1109
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,159
I can walk.

1110
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,159
Well, then, let's walk.

1111
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,439
Can I come in?

1112
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,199
Yeah.

1113
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,599
Come on;
Get undressed.

1114
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,039
You are a real live injun, hmm?

1115
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,839
I bet you're
a good dad.

1116
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:47,279
It's too bad your kids
never get to see you.

1117
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,999
I'm--I'm going
this winter.

1118
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,519
Want to go with me?

1119
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:02,039
One day at a time,
all right?

1120
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,399
Hey.

1121
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,039
Lazy lady.

1122
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,399
Come on, sleepy,
get up.

1123
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,199
Wake up.

1124
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,799
I was dreaming so much.

1125
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,559
I want my baby back, Dean.

1126
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,559
I want Alexis.

1127
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,999
You know, if you
stop talking so much

1128
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,399
about what you want,
stop being so selfish,

1129
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:31,519
maybe what you want
will come to you on its own.

1130
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,959
Okay.

1131
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,279
I'm just mad
'cause I suck.

1132
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,519
Shit.

1133
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,719
Dean?

1134
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:49,919
Yeah?

1135
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,279
Do you have
a long sleeve shirt

1136
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,879
or something I could borrow?

1137
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,719
I can't go out like this.

01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,799
Baby bird.

1159
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,079
They're sleeping.

1160
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,759
How was work today?

1161
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,799
How'd you get in here?

1162
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,159
I'm the one
who asks the questions.

1163
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,839
I don't answer.

1164
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,159
Fuck me, snoopy.

1165
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,599
You got to give me
a break.

1166
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,759
You look terrible.

1167
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,839
Yeah.

1168
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,959
What's going on?

1169
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,639
I'm going to tell you
the truth.

1170
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,079
I'm in trouble.

1171
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,559
I'm dirty.

1172
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,159
You want to get clean?

1173
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,039
You want inpatient?

1174
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,359
No, I want outpatient.

1175
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,359
Or prison.

1176
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,999
No, because
I have to keep this job.

1177
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,719
Inpatient or prison.

1178
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:20,879
This job is the only thing
that I haven't--

1179
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,199
please, please,
let me keep this job.

1180
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,399
It's inpatient
or prison.

1181
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,879
Hello.

1182
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,279
Yeah, I got my PO here.

1183
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,679
Can I call you back?

1184
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,919
Please, please, please,
please, please.

1185
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,599
I lost my daughter.
I lost her.

1186
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,199
I don't know--there's no
other way I can get her back.

1187
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,679
Inpatient or prison;
Your choice.

1188
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,519
Ugh!

1189
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,399
You know,
I don't get you.

1190
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,759
You want to get clean.

1191
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,199
You don't want
to do the work.

1192
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,159
You want your daughter,

1193
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,599
but you don't want
to do the work.

1194
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,359
I wish it could be
some other way,

1195
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,319
but at this point,

1196
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,119
you do not qualify
for outpatient.

1197
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,479
Take the weekend.

1198
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,719
Say good-bye
to your family.

1199
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,399
Report to me Monday morning
at 8:00 A.M.,

1200
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,799
and I will take you down.

1201
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,159
If I don't see you,
I will issue a warrant

1202
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,559
for your arrest.

1203
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,079
You're probably not
going to believe this,

1204
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,319
but I think about you
all the time.

1205
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,279
You're my sister.

1206
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,359
I never forgot you.

1207
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,039
You snaked me
with that bitch, Bobby.

1208
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,559
I can't trust you.

1209
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,759
I want you to get to know
your daughter, Sherry.

1210
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,079
I really do.

1211
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,759
But you got to put yourself
in our shoes.

1212
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,599
Lynette loves
that little girl

1213
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,159
like she was her own,
and to tell you the truth,

1214
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,759
I do too.

1215
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,519
Why don't you
have your own kid,

1216
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,359
leave mine alone?

1217
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,879
We've been taking care of her.

1218
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,759
You think that's easy?

1219
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,639
And we are going
to have our own kid,

1220
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,719
maybe even two,

1221
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,799
but we've been taking care
of Alexis

1222
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,319
because of you,
remember?

1223
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,479
I know, I know.

1224
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,879
I fucked up.

1225
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,999
I always fuck up.

1226
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,319
I know what
you've been through.

1227
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,719
Don't think I don't know
what you've been through.

1228
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,119
What's that mean?

1229
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,799
It means
I'm on your side.

1230
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:53,759
Oh, yeah?

1231
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,839
Yeah.

1232
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,399
It means I'm on your side,
okay?

1233
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,079
I'm on your fucking
side.

1234
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,639
So will you let me
take her out alone,

1235
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,679
just me and her,

1236
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,359
so she's not
scared of me anymore?

1237
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,039
Okay.

1238
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,959
Okay, but no sleepovers,
okay?

1239
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,559
One step at a time,
okay?

1240
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,959
You love me?

1241
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,439
Yes, I love you.

1242
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,159
I know.

1243
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,919
I can tell.

1244
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:23,959
No!

1245
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,759
Alexis.

1246
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,359
Oh, hi.

1247
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,519
Hey.

1248
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,879
Hi.

1249
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,159
Alexis,
go put on your shoes.

1250
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,559
Sherry's here
to take you.

1251
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,439
I'll go get her ready.

1252
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,199
I hope you're happy,

1253
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,679
because nobody else is.

1254
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,839
Excuse me.

1255
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,359
Come on,
put your shoesies on, okay?

1256
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,799
And you should like...

1257
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,399
Hey, Lexi.

1258
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,679
What is it, baby?

1259
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,039
I don't want to go, Bobby.

1260
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,359
It's okay, sweetie.

1261
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,719
You're going to have a fun day
with your mother.

1262
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,079
Why, baby?
You scared?

1263
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,839
You can tell mama.

1264
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,199
Let's pack her green shirt too,
just in case she gets dirty.

1265
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,799
Okay.

1266
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,279
I got it.

1267
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,559
Alexis, let's put
your backpack on.

1268
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,399
Come on, sweetie,
please.

1269
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,359
I don't want to go, Bobby.

1270
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,319
Sweetie, come on;
It's going to be fun.

1271
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,599
Here, I'll carry you out,
okay?

1272
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,839
Don't forget this.

1273
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:20,839
You look so pretty
in this.

1274
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,079
Oh, what a big girl.

1275
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,119
Come here; Let me
put this on you.

1276
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,839
Keep your hair
out of your face.

1277
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,239
I'll see you later,
okay,

1278
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,119
and make some cheeseburgers
for supper, okay?

1279
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,599
Okay, have fun.

1280
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,039
Bye, Lyn.

1281
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,359
Okay.

1282
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,719
You're gonna have
a fun day, okay?

1283
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,999
Remember what I told you?

1284
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:52,279
You're gonna have fun.

1285
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,319
Can you get the door?

1286
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,399
It's going to be a good time;
I promise, okay?

1287
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,399
Come on, let go.

1288
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,599
Let go, baby.

1289
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,959
Okay.

1290
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,479
No, no, no, no,
put it in the front seat.

1291
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,039
Sherry, it has to go
in the back; That's the law.

1292
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,959
Always in the back, okay?

1293
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:12,999
Come here, sweetie.

1294
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,279
Come on, please.

1295
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,039
Come on.
Here we go.

1296
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,719
Put your legs down.

1297
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,199
Just like our car.

1298
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,039
I don't want to go,
Bobby.

1299
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,279
Okay, but see,
this is the day

1300
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,639
that you get to know Sherry
better, okay?

1301
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,039
Okay?

1302
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,319
Okay.

1303
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,479
I don't want to go.

1304
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,439
You don't want to go?

1305
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,719
Well, listen to me.

1306
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,239
You're going to have fun,
okay?

1307
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,959
I promise.

1308
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,119
Okay.

1309
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,679
What time are you
going to have her back?

1310
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,119
Um...

1311
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,639
I don't know,
4:00 or something.

1312
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,359
Okay, 4:00.

1313
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,039
Hey. You okay, baby?

1314
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,319
Are you okay?

1315
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,239
She's okay.

1316
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,559
She'll be--
she'll be all right.

1317
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,479
Alexis,
it's going to be okay.

1318
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,839
You're going to have
a fun day, okay?

1319
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,079
You're going to have
a good time.

1320
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,039
Have fun with her,
okay?

1321
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,159
Thanks.

Yeah.

1332

You want junk food?

1333
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:45,639
Yes.

1334
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,519
Yes.

1335
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,479
I'm starving.

1336
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,399
Me too.

1337
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,159
You want to push it?

1338
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,959
I want chicken nuggets.

1339
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,119
Okay.

1340
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,079
And I want to eat...

1341
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,119
French fries.

1342
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,039
I want French fries too.

1343
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,279
And...

1344
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,479
So when are we going to get
to miniature golf?

1345
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,279
Soon.

1346
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,479
Really soon.

1347
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,239
I've never did
miniature golf before.

1348
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,359
You never did?

1349
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,559
Uh-uh, never.

1350
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,799
That's a shame.

1351
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,479
Did you ever go
to Florida?

1352
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,079
Florida?

1353
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,039
Yeah.

1354
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,119
No.

1355
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,039
Me neither.

1356
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,439
You want to go?

1357
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,519
Lyn and Bobby went,

1358
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,239
and I stayed
at grandma Mary's.

1359
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,959
Hmm.

1360
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:42,999
She--she lets me stay up late
and watch late movies...

1361
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,319
This thing
looks like it hurts.

1362
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:49,039
And has a little dog
that's named Isabella.

1363
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,199
It's mean?

1364
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,719
No, it's named Isabella,
but it's a nice dog.

1365
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,679
It's a little
French bulldog.

1366
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:01,319
So do you want to go
to Florida?

1367
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,279
Mommy?

1368
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,999
Yes, my love?

1369
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,279
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1370
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,279
You do?

1371
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,919
Okay, let's go.
One more.

1372
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,039
Come on, God damn it.

1373
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,519
Go in the bathroom.

1374
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,679
Jesus Christ.

1375
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,319
You like embarrassing me
like that?

1376
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:27,239
Do you?

1377
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,759
The fuck is wrong with
you?

1378
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,919
Why don't you
answer me?

1379
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,119
You never listen
to me.

1380
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,559
You never answer me.

1381
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,439
Look at me
when I talk to you.

1382
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,479
You want me
to leave you here?

1383
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,559
Is that what you want?

1384
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,999
You're lucky
that I'm here with my girl,

1385
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,599
or I'd beat the fucking shit
out of you, you fucking bully.

1386
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,719
Lexis?

1387
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,439
Lexis,
I'm sorry.

1388
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,079
Lexi, Lexi.

1389
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,079
Hey, baby.

1390
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,079
Alexis,
what are you doing?

1391
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,839
Did you go
to the bathroom?

1392
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,319
Lexi,
open up the door.

1393
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,559
Open up the door.

1394
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,479
Come here.
What is it?

1395
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,279
Oh, what happened?

1396
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,199
It's okay.

1397
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,239
I'm scared, Sherry.

1398
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,759
It's okay.

1399
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,199
All right.

1400
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,599
Ah, fuck.

1401
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,359
Let's get these wet pants
off you.

1402
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,959
Come on, you got to help me
get your shoes off.

1403
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,079
Oh--come on.
Jesus.

1404
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,359
Okay, and you do
the other one.

1405
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,839
Fuck me.

1406
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,319
Okay, look what I got.

1407
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,799
Oh--

1408
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,359
what's that?

1409
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,959
Oh, look at this.

1410
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:15,639
Come on, baby.

1411
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:16,999
I'm trying.

1412
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,919
Come here.

1413
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,159
Okay,
take your panties off, Lex.

1414
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,799
Sherry, close the door.

1415
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,919
Hey, you got to help me.

1416
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,559
All right.

1417
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,359
Come on, left foot.

1418
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,639
Left foot.

1419
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:36,919
Do you even love me?

1420
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,279
I peed my pants.

1421
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,999
Tell me you love me.

1422
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:48,999
I love you.

1423
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,879
Tell me,
"I love you, mommy."

1424
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,519
I love you, mommy.

1425
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,599
Come on.

1426
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,839
You know what?

1427
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:20,439
I used to get scared too...

1428
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:21,759
All the time.

1429
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,519
Watch your step, honey.

1430
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,679
Why don't you go
say hi to Lynnie?

1431
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,319
She's worried about you.

1432
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,319
Lyn. Come here, Lyn.
I got to tell you something.

1433
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,839
Did you guys have fun?

1434
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,879
Yeah.

1435
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,119
Thanks for calling.

1436
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,799
You know what, Bob?

1437
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,119
What?

1438
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,559
I never asked you this
the whole time that I was away.

1439
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,439
I never asked you...

1440
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,999
Asked me what, Sherry?

1441
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,439
Could you help me
take care of my daughter?

1442
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,719
I can't do it by myself.

1443
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,799
Of course I can.

1444
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,359
What do you think
I've been doing?

1445
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,319
I know,
but I never asked you.

1446
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:08,959
Come here.

1447
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,719
Yes.

1448
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,839
You're gonna be okay.

1449
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,159
You want
to come inside?

1450
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,879
No.

1451
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,919
You think you were worried
about Lexi.

1452
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,279
Dean's probably waiting
by the window for his baby.

1453
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,519
