                                        <li><u>Governing Law and Rules for Arbitration.</u> The Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Arbitration must proceed only with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS. The rules for the arbitration will be the procedures of the chosen arbitration organization. If the organization's procedures change after the claim is filed, the procedures in effect when the claim was filed will apply. Arbitration hearings will take place in Minnesota. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator must:

                                                <li>Follow all applicable substantive law, except when contradicted by the FAA;</li>
                                                <li>Follow applicable statutes of limitations;</li>
                                                <li>Honor valid claims of privilege; and</li>
                                                <li>Issue a written decision including the reasons for the award.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>
                                                The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding except for any review allowed by the FAA. However, if more than $100,000 was genuinely in dispute, then either you or EGW may choose to appeal to a new panel of three arbitrators. The appellate panel is completely free to accept or reject the entire original award or any part of it. The appeal must be filed with the arbitration organization not later than 30 days after the original award issues. The appealing party pays all appellate costs unless the appellate panel determines otherwise as part of its award. Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction.
