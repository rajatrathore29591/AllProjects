                                    <li><u>Personal Information Collected</u> There are areas on the Site where you can share information that is unique to an individual; such as your name, company name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, zip code, and credit card information (collectively “Personal Information”).  You can also purchase products with your credit card.  Accordingly, we may request your credit card information for shipping, billing, and credit card validation purposes.  We ask for this information to deliver requested materials to you, respond to your questions, or deliver a product.  If you communicate with us by e-mail or complete online forms, we may require Personal Information that personally identifies you.  EGW may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of having someone contact you for additional information, or in response to your request for information from us.  All the foregoing is treated as Personal Information, as described in this policy.</li>
                                    <li><u>Information from Children</u> EGW does not knowingly solicit or collect information (including <b>Traffic Data</b> or Personal Information) from anyone under 13 years of age.  The use of the Site by anyone under 13 years of age is prohibited.  We ask that anyone under 13 years of age not submit information to us.  However, when we e-mail information to you, we will provide prominently displayed instructions that show you how to unsubscribe from receiving such information.  If your child subscribes to receive information from EGW without your knowledge, simply follow the instructions on our e-mail and unsubscribe immediately.  Parents can also contact our customer service department to access, change, or delete the Personal Information that has been submitted by a child.</li>
                                    <li><u>Cookies.</u> EGW may collect information about you and your use of the Site whenever you visit the Site. For instance, we may collect various forms of information such as entry and exit points for the Site (i.e., referring URLs or domain names), site traffic statistics, operating system and browser type (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. In addition, when you request pages on the Site, our servers automatically log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or mobile device whenever you are surfing the Web. EGW may store some information on your computer or mobile device in the form of a “<b>cookie</b>” or similar file to help us maintain and improve the Site in many ways. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording such things as Internet addresses, passwords, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.  With most Internet browsers, you can erase “cookies” from your computer or mobile device hard drive, block all “cookies,” or receive a warning before a “cookie” is stored. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. Enabling cookies allows you to take full advantage of all the features on the Site and we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you elect to block the cookies, we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience on the Site.
                        <p>BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES, YOU CONSENT TO EGW’S USE OF COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE HARD DRIVE. </p>
